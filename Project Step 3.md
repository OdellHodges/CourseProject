Annually, there are approximately 200,000 transitioning service members who integrate back into society after proudly serving their country for numerous years. Of the number of transitioning servicemembers, there are countless individuals who deal with the arduous process of separating from an overseas location. This process can be agitating due to the substantial lack of informational resources, medical/dental facilities, and inability to solidify job opportunities within the United States due to geographical posture. Additionally, the are various other proponents of ambiguity which surrounds an individual in a foreign space, who may perhaps would elect to stay in the overseas location and does not have the adequate resources to initiate their request. 
There is an unfilled consumer service market for individuals who are outside of the United States that require insight and direction. The military pre-separation seminar and various other transitioning services do very little for members of the Armed Forces. Often, the information given is disseminated in a manner where it can be overwhelm given the short duration of time given to process all the viable information. Furthermore, most of the advantageous opportunities delineated in the pre-separation seminar is specifically catered towards individuals within the Continental United States. Therefore, where should an individual go to find answers and opportunities while stationed overseas? By implementing a proper networking system which will enable Users to Interact with Admins, Interservice Representatives from Transition Offices and recent servicemembers who dealt with similar hurdles, it is easier to prevent servicemembers from failing to receive substantial information.
The Network application has an audience which is it designated to be catered to. Additionally, due to the immense annual attrition rate for veterans, there will always be a valid consumer market to utilize the service.  The major contribution associated with the Network application will be an opportunity for veterans, transitioning servicemembers and transition counselors to assist all participants in providing substantial, quantitative information to the end user. For instance, the SkillBridge program is something which is highly emphasized by the Department of Defense as a viable tool for transitioning servicemembers to take advantage of. Within the United States, there is a greater emphasis provided on the benefits of the program, along with a simplified application process. However, in overseas locations, this program is seldom spoken about, and components of the application process remain obscure to those overseas. 
The Network application should have liaisons to stateside hub centers for all branches of service (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, & Space Force). The hub centers will serve as administrative centers for counselors to provide information on how to conduct specific transitioning procedures within the United States. The counselors will cultivate and maintain Standard Operating Procedures for various request for all individual branches of service. The SOPs will also be maintained on the Network Application as a referenced “smart pack” for initiating specific requests OCONUS. 
The active role veterans play in assisting those who may be feeling the same anxiety they once felt, is a golden opportunity for those to “pay-it-forward” to individuals who may have assisted them on their journey out of the service. In order to maintain current and up-to-date information, it would be effective to have a mechanism to deactivate a veterans account after 365 days after their last day of active service.
